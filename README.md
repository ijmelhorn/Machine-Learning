# Unit-11-Machine-Learning
Imbalanced Learn and Ensemble Learning

Built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so I needed to employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes.

I used the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate the models using Resampling and Ensemble Learning to assess balanced accuracy, recall, and geometric mean scoring.
